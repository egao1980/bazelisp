Common Lisp support for Bazel
=============================

This repository provides support for compiling Common Lisp code using
[bazel](https://bazel.build/).

Bazel provides safe and fast, hermetic and deterministic, incremental
build for software written in a mix of languages notably including C++,
Java, Go, Python, Javascript --- and now Common Lisp.

Our Lisp support will use SBCL to build standalone Common Lisp executables
that statically link all C/C++ libraries
except the most basic ones: `libc`, `libm`, etc.
This makes it easier to deploy or debug production binaries
without having to worry about subtle installation issues
or discrepancies between installations.

See our [article for ELS 2016](doc/els2016.pdf) for an explanation of
what is Bazel, what our Lisp support does and how it works.

Support is currently experimental, and currently requires you to
manually setup your `WORKSPACE`. See according section below.


Limitations as compared to ASDF
-------------------------------

[ASDF](http://common-lisp.net/project/asdf/) is lightweight,
and these days it too can produce statically linked executables,
for CLISP as well as for SBCL, and on macOS and Windows as well as on Linux.
ASDF will also load the Lisp code it builds directly into
the current image used by your development environment.
But ASDF is not particularly safe, fast, hermetic or deterministic,
and mostly only supports Common Lisp.

Bazel is safe, fast, hermetic and deterministic, and supports many languages.
However, on the one hand Bazel isn't lightweight at all, and on the other hand,
it doesn't allow building then loading code in the current image.
Many systems use ASDF extensions or wrappers
with no current equivalent for Bazel, for which you may have to write
corresponding Bazel extensions or source code tweaks.

Currently, Bazel only supports SBCL, only on x86-64, only using Linux or macOS.
Supporting other operating systems is not conceptually difficult,
but will require work.
Bazel and SBCL both notably already run on Windows,
and both provide infrastructure for conditional compilation,
so it's "just" a matter of gluing things together.
Supporting other implementations and/or other architectures
will be somewhat harder, and the result may not match SBCL on x86-64:
SBCL notably got a new "fasteval" interpreter that was
specially optimized to accelerate building with Bazel.


Setting up your WORKSPACE
-------------------------

Copy or symlink [lisp.WORKSPACE.bzl](lisp.WORKSPACE.bzl) into the
toplevel directory of your Bazel workspace, and edit your toplevel
`WORKSPACE` file to include the following:

    load("/lisp.WORKSPACE", "lisp_repositories")
    lisp_repositories(bazelisp="/path/to/bazelisp", sbcl="/path/to/base/of/sbcl")

The path to `bazelisp` is the full Unix path to
the directory containing this `README.md` file.

The path to the base of `sbcl` is
the `--prefix` argument used when building SBCL.
This would be `/usr` when using sbcl from a debian or RPM package for SBCL,
or `/usr/local` by default when building SBCL from source.
The SBCL executable is `bin/sbcl` under this base directory
whereas the SBCL support files are in `lib/sbcl/` under that base directory.
For instance, I (Far√©) personally use `stow`
to manage local software under either `/usr/local` or `~/local`,
and my SBCL path is `/home/fare/local/stow/sbcl`. YMMV.

By default, this SBCL installation is used only to bootstrap
the hermetic version of SBCL from the `@lisp__sbcl//` external repository.
But if you used the `@lisp__sbcl//...` targets to precompile a SBCL
installation that has all the patches and features expected by Bazel, and
you checked it into your source control with enough hermeticity, then
you can shorten your Common Lisp builds by using that directly
rather than rebuilding SBCL in every new checkout
(assuming you don't have a shared distributed cache).
To that effect, edit `bazel/rules.bzl` and
change the value of the variable `SBCL_PACKAGE` to be
`"@lisp__sbcl_binary_distribution//:"` instead of `"@lisp__sbcl//:"`.
(TODO: make that somehow easier to configure).


Using bazel to build Lisp code
------------------------------

Once your `WORKSPACE` is setup, you can build Lisp code with a command
like:

    ( cd /path/to/bazel ; JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk8 ./output/bazel build @lisp__hello//:hello )

Of course, you can and probably should create a small shell script or
shell function that will properly invoke `bazel` for you from the
proper workspace.


Building additional or updated Lisp systems
-------------------------------------------

If you want to build additional or updated Lisp systems,
edit the `lisp.WORKSPACE.bzl` file to modify an existing entry or add a new one
for each corresponding repository that you want to build.
Similar modify or add `BUILD` files and ancillary support files,
located in the [build_defs/](build_defs/) directory.
For now, see our existing `BUILD` files as examples,
because our documentation is otherwise lacking.

For repositories that include their own `BUILD` and `WORKSPACE` files,
use `native.local_repository()`, `native.http_archive()`, and
`native.git_repository()`, etc.
If they do not include their own `BUILD` file (they usually won't), then
create or edit one in [build_defs/](build_defs/)
and use the variants `native.new_local_repository()`,
`native.new_http_archive()`, and `native.new_git_repository()`, etc.
Note that the naming convention for the workspace is
`lisp__foo_bar` where `foo_bar` is the name of your package
with any dash or period replaced by an underscore.
The convention is to name the corresponding build file `lisp__foo_bar.BUILD`
and to name any ancillary file starting with the prefix `lisp__foo_bar.`
to identify what repository uses it.
